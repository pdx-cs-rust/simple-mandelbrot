# simple-mandelbrot: simplified Mandelbrot Set renderer
Bart Massey 2021

This is as simple as Mandelbrot Set rendering gets, with no
command-line arguments and output as ASCII
[NetPGM](http://netpbm.sourceforge.net/doc/pgm.html). It
took about an hour to write, debug and deploy.

Run with `sh run.sh` to produce `mandelbrot.png`. You must
have the `NetPBM` tools installed.
